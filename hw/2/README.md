**2.** Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer   
**3.** For storing values and loops    
**4.** Cache Memory  
**5.** Disk  
**6.** Bit  
**7.** a.) Assembly Language  b.) Yes.  
**8** a.) Fortran b.) Six decades (almost)  
**9.** a.) Colbol b.) 3rd-Generation  
**10.** The 1970's, the 1980's, & the 1990's.  
**11.** BCPL  
**12.** C, Simula.  
**13.** Fortran  
**14.** Registers  
**15.** A byte (or bytes).  
**16.** Significantly faster.    
**17.** A lot Faster  
**18.** Faster, but not by much.  
**19.** Transistors act as an on/off switch of sorts They either allow or prevent currents from flowing through to represent the binary digit 1, or they cut it off to represent 0.      
**20.** Because the chips would have to be made larger. This isn't feasible for most computers.  
**21.** Fetch, decode, & Execute.  
**22.** Determines the # of cycles of operations a processor can perform x second. This would lead to faster task processing.  
**23.** CPU. CPU supports higher-end GPU.  
**24.** The main difference between the two is that Dennard Scaling is related to power scaling. However, they are related because Moore's law provides more switches and D.S. keeps them efficient.
