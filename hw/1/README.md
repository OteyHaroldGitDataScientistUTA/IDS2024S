**1.** [Here is the README file I created](../../README.md)  
**2.**  Local, Centralized, and Distributed.  
**3.** Distributed VCS is the best kind. It is the best because it is less reliant on a single backup and has more clones from the project database. Which can restore the central repository.   
**4.** I will briefly define the following terms: 

**git pull** - "Downloads bookmark history and incorporates changes"    
**git status** - "Lists all new or modified files to be committed"   
**git add --all** - "add changes from all tracked and untracked files"  
**git commit -m"latest build"** - "Records file snapshots permanently in version history"  
**git push --all** - "Uploads all local branch commits to GitHub"
