**QUIZ 1 ANSWERS**

**1.** ".md" stands for markdown. We prefer to use .md extension for README.md files because it gives us a set of rules for creating functions.  

**2.**  The git software index **does not** track empty folders in our project. Something has to be there.  

**3.**  Yes. 

**4.**  The purpose of the .git folder in projects is to index the specific sections of your project. (ex. quiz, hw, exam folders in this past hw.)  

**5.**  The Linux bash command "cd" means change to home.  

**6.**  The command "ls- a" formats listings with hidden files.  

**7.**  The command "pwd" shows the current directory.  

**8.**  The three areas of a GIT project are the **Working directory**- where the project is modified but not staged, **the staging directory**- where the project can be staged to commit to the repository, and **the .git repository.**- where the project is committed; or becomes permanent.  

**9.** A Version control system **(or VCS)** is a system (e.g., software) that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later.  

**10.** 6 major benefits of using distributed VCS as opposed to not using any VCS at all for project indexing and maintenance are- Data redundancy and storage efficiency, Low risk of errors and irreversible mistakes, Less difficulty in tracking minor developments in the project, less ambiguity in version differences, less sharing and collaboration difficulties, & less potential risk of complete data loss. 

**11.** The three historical classes of VCS are: local, centralized, and distributed VCS. 

**12.** Git is coding software, GitHub is the cloud. 

**13.** Git status - "Lists all new or modified files to be committed." 

**14.** Git push --all - "Uploads all local branch commits to GitHub." 

**15.** Git pull - "Downloads bookmark history and incorporates changes." 

**16.** "Markdown is a way to style text on the web. You control the display of the document; formatting words as
bold or italic, adding images, and creating lists are just a few of the things we can do with Markdown. Mostly,
Markdown is just regular text with a few non-alphabetic characters thrown in, like # or *"

**17.** You make a text boldfaced by placing "**" on both sides of a given text. 

**18.** You make a text italic by placing "*" on both sides of a given text. 

**19.** The command is "git init"

**20.** ".." means parent folder and "." means the child essentially. 

**21.** We did not have enough time to do this last part. I have studied a lot and the first 20 questions took almost the entire class period. This is all completely new to me, so my apologies that I was not finished. I hope that you will have grace. I did my very best, this is just a beginners class.
