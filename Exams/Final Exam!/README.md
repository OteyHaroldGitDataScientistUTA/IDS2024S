**1.**  Validation- Comparing model behavior to a system  calibration- comparing it to the system not just by behavior.   
**2.**  All data visualizations map data values into quantifiable features of the resulting graphic. We refer to these features as aesthetics.  
**3.**  The second one because it is better for all to see.   
**4.**  A- Intrinsic Order B- Color to rep data values C- Diverging color scale D- Color as a tool to highlight  
**5.**  Experimentary, Theory, and Simulation.  
**6.**  No. Logical implication suggests that "if it is cloudy, it is going to rain" But physical causation says that "because it is going to rain, it is cloudy".  
**7.**  1. Yes. Because it is going the same way the red line is going. This shows the temperature increase over a period. 2. I would guess technology was behind. 3. Positive correlation 4. Yes, because it shows data and proves it over time.  
**8.**  Bayesian approach  
**9.**  Also the Bayesian Approach  
**10.**  Bayes theorem  
**11.**  Nobody on the titanic would have been below age zero -lecture-  
**12.**  Because it's essentially the alphabet of the language computers use. Everything is represented by zeros or ones.     
**13.**  B, Fortran, or BCPL.  
**14.**  Fortran.

**17.** Deductive and plausible reasoning. *D*- if a is true then b is true. *P*- if A is true, then b is true, therefore A becomes more plausible.  ex. It will rain by 10 am at the latest, so therefore there must be rainclouds before 10 am.   
**18.**  That the two have the same logical value.

**20.**  No, sadly. Real numbers aren't quantifiable.
